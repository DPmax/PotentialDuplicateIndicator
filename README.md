# PotentialDuplicateIndicator

The Problem
-----------
This is a real problem we encountered and dealt with here.  Our advertiser database had duplicate entries with slightly different names for the same advertiser.
One such example is: "1-800-Flowers.com" and "1800Flowers.com"
   
The Challenge
-------------
Write a program in the language of your choice that accepts as input a text file of advertiser names and outputs potential duplicate advertisers.


A text file contains duplicate entries with slightly different names for the same advertise. Outputs potential duplicate advertisers.
